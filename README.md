My name is Muhammad Hamza Siddiqui. I am currently studying in FAST-NUCES Karachi campus. Having a Pre engineering A level background I am new to coding and but am really interested. We started studying C language in the first semester and my goal at the end of the semester is to use what I study practically other than making the final Project.
